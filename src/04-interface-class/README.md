## What’s Object-oriendted Programming(OOP)?

### Work with Entities in Code

- 현실세계에 존재하는 객체 지향적으로 프로그래밍하는 것이다.
- 사람의 사고 방식에 가깝게 코딩할 수 있다.
- 객체의 유기적인 관계 표현 할 수 있다.

### Object

- The things you work with in code
- Data structures we use to store data,to store methods excute methods on classes are blueprints
- **instances of classes (=based on classes)**

### Class

- Blueprints for Object (theoretical definition)
- Define how object look like, which properties and methods they have
  → If object is based on such a class so that we can quickly replicate multiple objects with the same structure, same methods based on the sample classes.
- Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier
  → classes exist to speed up the creation of objects and it’s simply and alternative to using the object.

### interface

- describes the structure of an object
- mostly can replace them with custom types
  → also can implement customtypes
  ⇒ but simply is more common to use an interface for describe object that want to implement it all the for historic reasons
  ⇒ becuase ealier dsays of TS custom types couldn't be implemented or used like interface
